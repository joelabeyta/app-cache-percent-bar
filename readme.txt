Watch out!!! The sass file (appcachePercent.scss) uses compass plugins.


ABOUT
____________

This is a percentage bar for the Application Cache. It simply counts the number of files and increases a progress by a percent of the total. It's only counts items in the application cache. Anything else will not be counted in the percent. So it's really only useful if you load everything through the application cache.
It's from a larger project I'm working on. I tried to clean everything up, but there might be some stuff left over from that. Please forgive if there is anything that doesn't seem necessary. I'll do a few updates as I finish the other project.

I initially wanted to use Pace.js for this because I love the simple designs/themes and automatedness. This uses a heavily modified version of their Barber theme.
